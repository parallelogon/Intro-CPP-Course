/*Goal: practice searching an array in C++
**There is an array of integers. The length of the arrays to be searched 
**varies. A user will enter an integer and the program will search the array.
**If the value is in the array, the program will return the location of 
**the element. If the value is not in the array, the user will be notified 
**that the value is not in the array. To exit the program the user will enter -1.
